## Take note
* Prices are from September 2023.
* Price calculations are made on basic food pouches which are in the form of powder.
* Most have a lot more offerings than the basic "soylent-like" food powder which started this trend.
* Discounts might affect the total price, so try not to take the final decision based on this list.
* If you're not satisfied with a producer's offering, try another.
